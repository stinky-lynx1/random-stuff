# A simple RNG written by me in Python 3.13!

## 1. How to use
1. Open it using your py editor or terminal/console, in case you have py installed
2. Initiate the script!
3. Follow the guidelines and...
4. End up with the randomest number ever!

## 2. Creator(s)
Yes, I did in fact do it, BUT! without @tjf1dev it would never be possible!

## 3. Plans
Since this is really a deadend project, I'm thinking of a better way to show it tho, maybe a HTML or CSS?? idk.
